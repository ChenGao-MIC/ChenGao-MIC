# About me ðŸ˜ƒ

**ChenGao-MIC/ChenGao-MIC** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on reporting via Tableau/Power Bi and providing decision driven data 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning GitHub and Markdown language.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on centralzied RIS data to create our own data warehouse/datalake 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I like swimming and biking in the sunny day. But still practicing and trying to imporve my free style technique.
